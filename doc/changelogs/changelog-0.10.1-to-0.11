changelog from version 0.10.1 to 0.11 - released 2014.7.xx

* New features

- Integration with eZPublish 5 (new stack) has begun!
  It is now much easier to use the extension from eZ5 context - watch out for a dedicated bundle in the future, though.
  (Also please do not complain about all the ugly thunking code which was added ;-) Keeping a single codebase working
  with 2 kernels is no easy feat)

  The guiding principles are:
  . to make it easy to add custom KPIs using the same php API, either from eZ5 or eZ-LS context
  . to still have the extension working perfectly in a pure-LS installation
  . to avoid as much as possible context switches within the extension itself, to avoid perf losses

- A new parameter has been added to methods ezPerflogger::disable() ( and ezPerflogger::reenable() as well ).
  It prevents the extension from measuring any accumulator timing point.
  It is recommended to use it when
  . your code adds custom KPI data, measured via calls to eZPerfLogger::accumulatorStart()/Stop()
  . you do not want to log performance data at all any more, but find disabling/removing ezperformancelogger too cumbersome
  A good place where to put such call is in config.php

- It is now possible to properly trace the http response code (but this still does not happen automatically out of the box)

* Bugfixes

- revamping (cleanup and bugfixes) of most existing "tracing" handlers (db, cluster, imagemagick)

* Changes

- BC BREAK: the eZPerfLoggerProvider::measure() method signature has changed; now it takes and extra, optional
            retcode parameter (used to trace http response status)

- BC BREAK: if you are using the VariableProviders coming from the extension, they have been renamed and/or the variables
            they provide have been shifted around. Check ezperformancelogger.ini for details and adapt your config accordingly

- updated license with proper copyright assignment to eZ Systems AS

- the javascript loading in frontend design for xhprof-measurement is disabled by default, as it can break some sites
