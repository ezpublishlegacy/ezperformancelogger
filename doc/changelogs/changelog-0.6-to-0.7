changelog from version 0.6 to 0.7 - released 2012.yy.xx

* New features
. The BIG new feature of this release: integration with Munin!
  More details in the INSTALL file
. When DebugOutput is enabled, it is possible to trace any of the existing time
  accumulators, provided its name is known
. Added a new method: eZPerfLogger::cleanup, which can be registered as ezexecution cleanup handler, to allow
  perf tracing of those pages which terminate with a redirect / direct exit
. Added a cronjob and a cli script to archive the perf log files (both apache-style and csv one).
  The cronjob only rotates the log files if they are above a set size, the cli script always archives them
. Added some php classes which can be used to measure db timings and cluster-db timings also when
  the standard DebugOutput is disabled

* Bugfixes

* Changes
. the default logging format if user does not set it has been changed from apache-log to csv
. the csv log format now has a timestamp as 1st column. This is used to speed up parsing the file (to produce eg. data for Munin)
