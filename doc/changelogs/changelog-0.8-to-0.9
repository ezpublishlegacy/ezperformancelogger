changelog from version 0.8 to 0.9 - released 2013.5.28

* New features

. all data from module_result can be logged (such as content class or node id)
  - this does not work in eZP 5 and later, unless a legacy pagelayout is used
  - when in eZP 5 and later, you need to add to your legacy pagelayout template the following snippet:
    {$module_result|make_global('moduleResult')}

. can now use Odoscope to log measured KPIs

. can now use Monolog to log measured KPIs - this gives us access to a vast set
  of log management infrastructure

. KPI names sent to Statsd can now include dynamic data (such as content class or node id) to allow grouping/filtering of data

. added custom tracer classes for eZP 5.1 and 4.4

. added 3 filters which allow to log only "problematic" pages, or a part of the whole:
  - slow executing pages
  - pages consuming too much memory
  - a random fraction of all pages
  see ezperformancelogger.ini for more details

. fix bug in pinba logger
. fix: allow custom loggers to modify page output
